    				<p>The story of Caribé Juice begins on a beach trip to the Dominican Republic. While relaxing on the white sands of Punta Cana, a local vendor offered us natural fruit juice. After trying some, we were struck by the freshness and distinct flavor of the juices. When we learned that the fruits used in these juices were prevalent throughout the Dominican Republic, and that farmers struggled to sell them there, we immediately wondered whether we could bring them to the United States. We thought it would be a great idea to start a company that would bring the great taste of this region to you in the healthiest and most affordable way possible, while giving Dominican farmers a wider opportunity to sell their produce in a sustainable way.  With Caribé, our aim to create an environment that positively impacts not only your taste buds, but the world around you also.</p>
